# hello-world
# A new beginning
# About myself:
# I retired from a CIO job to set a new exciting career.  So here I am at GitHub setting the stage for the programming component of my new endeavor. To ensure the success of this new track,(1) it must capitalize on my strengths, (2) it must be highly relevant and provide significant impact to the business or scientific community, and (3) that I should stand out above the crowd in this field.
